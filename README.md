# Purpose
The goal of this project is to accurately determine the outcome of Falcon 9 rocket launches to yield financial benefits.

# Context and Motivation
SpaceX, a leader in the space industry, advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, priced at $62 million. In contrast, other providers offer solutions upwards of $165 million each. A significant portion of the cost savings stems from SpaceX's innovative ability to reuse the first stage of its rockets. Hence, accurately predicting whether the first stage will land successfully holds immense financial implications, directly influencing the cost of a launch. Such insights become invaluable for potential competitors seeking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts, allowing for informed decision-making and strategic positioning in the market.
